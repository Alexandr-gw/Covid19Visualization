# SQL_Covid19VisualizationProject

This project is my version of Covid19 data visualization.

For further visualization, I highlight 4 main data sets that I will use:
-The global number of infected, the probability of death during infection;
-The number of deaths in individual regions, mortality in percent;
-Number of infected population in a particular country;
-Change in the percentage of cases throughout the pandemic.
