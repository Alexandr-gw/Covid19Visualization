# Covid19Visualization

This project is my version of Covid19 data visualization.
For further visualization, I highlight 4 main data sets that I will use:

-The global number of infected, the probability of death during infection;

-The number of deaths in individual regions, mortality in percent;

-Number of infected population in a particular country;

-Change in the percentage of cases throughout the pandemic.

The visualization results can be seen at the link:
